From jose, re the python bof at SC 2009

The BoF was very well attended -- standing room only. There were probably about
100 people in the room. Spotz from Sandia Labs was there and it was a very
interesting presentation regarding NVIDIA "copperhead" python-to-GPU
programming. It's still very early in development, but looks very promising.

No word on a corresponding workshop, though. The SC09 committee surveys the
attendance of each of these BoF's and uses that as input for subsequent related
events -- tutorials, workshops, etc. There is a lot of interest and some of the
topics you brought up with your meeting with Guido surfaced -- especially GIL.

Anyway, given the strength of the attendance, hopefully this will result in
subsequent Python for HPC material at the next conference, which is in New
Orleans.

Just parenthetically, I also attended the high-level languages series, which
included Matlab. Outside of the ability to distribute an array on multiple
nodes, I really didn't see anything that was light years ahead of what you all
have already implemented in IPython. In fact, during the question session, some
professor brought up the fact that it was too expensive for his institution to
continue to teach parallel programming using Matlab. Obviously, they weren't
too happy to discuss that publicly.

The Centos build (which includes associated binaries) has IPython in it.

Hopefully, ptoolsrte will become part of the standard software installation for HPCMP and will thereby have IPython in it by default. That would be huge (~6000 DoD users ) at four major computational centers around the country would have this.
