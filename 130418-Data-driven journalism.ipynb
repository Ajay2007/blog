      "As \"software eats the world\" and we become awash in the flood of quantitative information denoted by the \"Big Data\" buzzword, it's clear that informed debate in society will increasingly depend on our ability to communicate information that is based on data.  And for this communication to be a truly effective *dialog*, it is necessary that the arguments made based on data can be deconstructed, analyzed, rebutted or expanded by others.  Since these arguments in practice often rely critically on the execution of code (whether an Excel spreadsheet or a proper program), it means that we really need tools to effectively communicate narratives that combine code, data and the interpretation of the results.  \n",

      "The computing community has for decades known about the [\"literate programming\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) paradigm introduced by [Don Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html) in the 70's and fully formalized in his famous 1992 book.  Briefly, Knuth's approach proposes writing computer programs in a format that mixes the code and a textual narrative together, and from this format generating separate files that will contain either an actual code that can be compiled/executed by the computer, or a narrative document that *explains* the program and is meant for human consumption.  The idea is that by allowing the authors to maintain a close connection between code and narrative, a number of benefits will ensue (clearer code, less programming errors, more meaningful descriptions than mere comments embedded in the code, etc).\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't take any issue with this approach per se, but I don't personally use it because it's not very well suited to the kinds of workflows that I need in practice.  These require the frequent execution of small fragments of code, in an iterative cycle where code is run to obtain partial results that inform the next bit of code to be written.  Such is the nature of interactive exploratory computing, which is the bread and butter of many practicing scientists.  This is the kind of workflow that led me to creating IPython over a decade ago, and it continues to inform basically every decision we make in the project today.\n",
      "\n",
      "As [Hamming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) famously said in 1962, *\"The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.\"*. IPython tries to help precisely in this kind of usage pattern of the computer, in contexts where there is no clear notion in advance of what needs to be done, so the user is the one driving the computation.  However, IPython also tries to provide a way to *capture* this process, and this is where we join back with the discussion above: while LP focuses on providing a narrative description of the structure of an algorithm, our working paradigm is one where the *act of computing* occupies the center stage. \n",
      "    \n",
      "From this perspective, we therefore refer to the worfklow exposed by these kinds of computational notebooks (not just IPython, but also Sage, Mathematica and others), as \"literate computing\": it is the weaving of a narrative directly into a live computation, interleaving text with code and results to construct a complete piece that relies equally on the textual explanations and the computational components.  For the goals of communicating results in scientific computing and data analysis, I think this model is a better fit than the literate programming one, which is rather aimed at developing software in tight concert with its design and explanatory documentation.  I should note that we have some ideas on how to make IPython stronger as a tool for \"traditional\" literate programming, but it's a bit early for us to focus on that, as we first want to solidify the computational workflows possible with IPython.\n",
      "    \n",
      "As I mentioned [in a previous blog post about the history of the IPython notebook](http://blog.fperez.org/2012/01/ipython-notebook-historical.html), the idea of a computational notebook is not new nor ours.  Several IPython developers used extensively other similar systems from a long time and we took lots of inspiration from them.  What we have tried to do, however, is to take a fresh look at these ideas, so that we can build a computational notebook that provides the best possible experience for computational work *today*.  That means taking the existence of the Internet as a given in terms of using web technologies, an architecture based on well-specified protocols and reusable low-level formats (JSON), a language-agnostic view of the problem and a concern about the entire cycle of computing from the beginning.  We want to build a tool that is just as good for individual experimentation as it is for collaboration, communication, publication and education."

      "In the last few years, extraordinarily contentious debates have raged in the circles of political power and fiscal decision making around the world, regarding the relation between government debt and economic growth.  One of the center pieces of this debate was a paper form Harvard economists C. Reinhart and K. Rogoff, later turned into a [best-selling book](http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com), that argued that beyond 90% debt ratios, economic growth would plummet precipitously.\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument was used (amongst others) by politicians to justify some of the extreme austerity policies that have been foisted upon many countries in the last few years.  On April 15, a team of researchers from U. Massachusetts [published a re-analysis](http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566) of the original data where they showed how Rienhart and Rogoff had made both fairly obvious coding errors in their orignal Excel spreadsheets as well as some statistically questionable manipulations of the data.  Herndon, Ash and Pollin (the U. Mass authors) published all their scripts in R so that others could inspect their calculations.\n",

      "Two posts from [the Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21576362-seminal-analysis-relationship-between-debt-and-growth-comes-under) and [the Roosevelt Institute](http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/researchers-finally-replicated-reinhart-rogoff-and-there-are-serious-problems) nicely summarize the story with a more informed policy and economics discussion than I can make.  James Kwak has a [series of posts](http://baselinescenario.com/2013/04/19/fatal-sensitivity) that dive into [technical detail](http://baselinescenario.com/2013/04/18/are-reinhart-and-rogoff-right-anyway/) and question the horrible choice of [using Excel](http://baselinescenario.com/2013/04/18/more-bad-excel/), a tool that should for all intents and purposes be banned from serious research as it entangles code and data in ways that more or less guarantee serious errors in anything but trivial scenarios.  Victoria Stodden just wrote [an excellent new post](http://blog.stodden.net/2013/04/19/what-the-reinhart-rogoff-debacle-really-shows-verifying-empirical-results-needs-to-be-routine/) with specific guidance on practices for better reproducibility; here I want to take a narrow view of these same questions focusing strictly on the tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "As reported in Mike Konczal's piece at the Roosevelt Institute, Herndon et al. had to reach out to Reinhart and Rogoff for the original code, which hadn't been made available before (apparently causing much frustration in economics circles).  It's absolutely unacceptable that major policy decisions that impact millions worldwide had until now hinged effectively on the unverified word of two scientists: no matter how competent or honorable they may be, we know everybody makes mistakes, and in this case there were both egregious errors and debatable assumptions.  As Konczal says, \"all I can hope is that future historians note that one of the core empirical points providing the intellectual foundation for the global move to austerity in the early 2010s was based on someone accidentally not updating a row formula in Excel.\" To that I would add the obvious: this should *never* have happened in the first place, as we should have been able to inspect that code and data from the start.\n",
